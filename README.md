## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)

### What I learned

Learned the basics of React and Sass.
How to use the clamp property to completely skip media queries. :))))))

### Useful resources

This was my first project built with React and Sass, so setting everything up took longer than i expected, but I am now 100% more confident on tackling both. I found out using functions as components is the best for a clean looking code, so I intend to use this snippet of code for React components from now on:

```js
function _Card() {
  return (
    <div className='card'>
    ...
    </div>
  )
}

export default _Card
```

As for Sass, finding where I can use mixins to speed up the coding is still a challenge. Overall, I just need more practice.
